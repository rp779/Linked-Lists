# singly linked list
A singly linked list implementation in c++
this version uses two pointers, front and back to access the linked list. If a user anticipates implementing a linked list such as this one, as a stack, the back pointer can be omitted. In fact, in it's current configuration, a pointer to the back of the linked list can be excluded altogether. In another project I will demonstrate the importance of having access to the back of a linked list when I implement a linked list as a queue.
