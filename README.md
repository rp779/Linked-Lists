# Linked Lists
This folder contains several projects from my Data Structures Course at FAU. Here you find that I have used linked lists to create stacks and queues of singly and doubly linked lists. 






# Singly Linked List (slist)
A singly linked list implementation in c++
this version uses two pointers, front and back to access the linked list. If a user anticipates implementing a linked list such as this one, as a stack, the back pointer can be omitted. In fact, in it's current configuration, a pointer to the back of the linked list can be excluded altogether. In another project I will demonstrate the importance of having access to the back of a linked list when I implement a linked list as a queue.
